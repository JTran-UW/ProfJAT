### I'm Josh, and this is my Github ðŸ‘‹

I'm a young and ambitious software engineer coming out of Seattle.  I mainly work in web development, data science/ML, and automation, but my greatest strength is an eager learning mindset.  These are my favorite projects from the past 4-5 years of software development.

I'm currently open to work!  Though I'm graduating high school this year, I plan on taking a gap year to explore the industry, so I'm looking for part-time and full-time positions, especially at a company making an impact in the community.

## Projects

## Computer Science II-IV
These are projects I completed as a part of my school's Computer Science class.  The requirements are my teacher's, but the ideas and implementation are all mine.
